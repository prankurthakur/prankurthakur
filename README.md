🚀 Hi, I'm Prankur

I’m building data and AI solutions focused on real-world systems like education, public policy, food systems, and public health.

My journey combines technical learning with deep exposure to how large public systems actually work. Before moving into AI and Data Science, I spent five years preparing for India’s civil services examination, which shaped my ability to analyze complex societal problems, understand policy structures, and think in long-term system outcomes.

Today, I’m focused on building human-first AI-technology that is ethical, context-aware, and grounded in real-world deployment constraints.

🌍 What I Care About Building

I’m especially interested in solving problems where data, policy, and human behavior intersect:

• Education system intelligence and access equity
• AI for public policy and governance transparency
• Nutrition and food system intelligence
• AI tools for social impact and development systems

I believe impactful AI must work not only in labs and models, but in messy real-world environments where policy, culture, and infrastructure all interact.

🧠 My Edge

What makes my approach different:

✔ Systems thinking from public policy preparation
✔ Strong communication from teaching global learners
✔ Domain context in food systems and development challenges
✔ Late-starter advantage mindset — fast learning + deep focus
✔ Strong interest in ethical and inclusive AI deployment

🛠 Current Technical Focus

• Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, NumPy)
• Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
• Exploratory Data Analysis
• Applied Machine Learning (In Progress)
• Generative AI & Applied AI Systems (Learning & Building)
